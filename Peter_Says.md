Who do people say the Son of Man is?
Jesus asked, "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the LIVING God.
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you because this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in Heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock 
I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven;
whatever you bind on Earth, will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth will be lost in heaven..."

From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem to suffer many things at the hands
of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life...

Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. " Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turnedd and said to Peter, "Get behind me Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, 
but whoever loses their life me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet foreit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they done.

Truly, I tell you that some who are standing will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom...

Get up. and Do Not Be Afraid.
When you look up, you will see Jesus. 
Amen.
