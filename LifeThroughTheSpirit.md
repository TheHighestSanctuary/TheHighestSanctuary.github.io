Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires;
but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind governed by the flesh is death,
but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace... The spirit gives life because of righteousness...
we have an OBLIGATION-- but it is not to the flesh... for if you live according to the flesh, you will die,
but if by through the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live... For those
who are led by the spirit of God are the Children of God.
The spirit you received does not make you slaves so that you live in fearnagain; raher, the spirit you
received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry. "Abba, Father."
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now, if we are children, then we are heirs--
heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in
his glory.

I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us. For the creation waits in eager
expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
