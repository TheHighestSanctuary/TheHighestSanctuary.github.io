Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord's unfailing love surrounds the one who trust in him....
For the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does. The Lord loves righteousness and justice;
the earth is FULL of his UNFAILING Love!

The Lord Foils the plans of the nations ; he thwarts the purpose of the peoples.
But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever the purposes of his heart through all generations.
