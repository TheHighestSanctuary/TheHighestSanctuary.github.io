Therefore, once more will I astound these people with wonder upon wonder;
the wisdom of the wise will perish,
the intelligence of the intellifent will vanish
and WOE to those who will go great depths to hide their plans from the Lord
who do their work in the darkness and think,
"Who sees us? Who will know?"
You turn things upside down as if the potter were thought to be like clay..
Can the pot say to the potter, "You know nothing?"
